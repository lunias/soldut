# Soldut

A 2D side-scrolling multiplayer mech shooter in C, in the lineage of Soldat.

The project is in **M1 — One mech, no network**: Verlet skeleton physics,
one chassis (Trooper), pulse-rifle hitscan, ragdoll on death, arm-only
dismemberment, blood particles + decal layer, hit-pause + screen shake,
HUD. Networking arrives at M2. See [documents/11-roadmap.md](documents/11-roadmap.md).

For the *current behavior* of the build (vs the design intent in
[documents/](documents/)) see [CURRENT_STATE.md](CURRENT_STATE.md) and
[TRADE_OFFS.md](TRADE_OFFS.md).

## Quick start

Three commands on a fresh Linux checkout:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev \
    libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libasound2-dev
make
./soldut
```

A 1280×720 window opens. You spawn on a small platform; a yellow target
dummy stands across the map.

Controls:

| Key            | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| `A` / `D`      | Run left / right |
| `W`            | Jet (consumes fuel) |
| `Space`        | Jump (when grounded) |
| `Mouse`        | Aim |
| `Left Mouse`   | Fire pulse rifle |

Hit the dummy enough and a) it ragdolls, b) its left arm comes off
once that limb's HP runs out.

## Cross-compiling

`zig cc` is the cross compiler. With Zig on `PATH`:

```bash
./cross-windows.sh    # → build/windows/Soldut.exe
./cross-macos.sh      # → build/macos/Soldut.app   (requires macOS SDK; see script)
```

for *intent*; the code is the source of truth for *behavior*. Read them in
order — they cross-reference each other.

## Status

### M0 — Foundation (done)

- [x] Project scaffolding, `Makefile`, `build.sh`
- [x] raylib + ENet + stb headers vendored, statically linked
- [x] Build matrix (`make`, `make windows`, `make macos`)
- [x] CI runs the build matrix on every push
- [x] Window, clear-color, FPS counter
- [x] Logger, arena allocator, pool allocator, math primitives

### M1 — One mech, no network (done)

- [x] Particle pool (SoA) + Verlet integrator
- [x] Constraint pool + 12-iter solver, constraints + map collisions interleaved per iter
- [x] Trooper chassis with the 16-particle skeleton + 21 distance constraints
- [x] Tile-grid map format + hard-coded tutorial level
- [x] Body-vs-map collision (per-particle vs tile rect, neighbour-aware exit)
- [x] Pose-driven animation (kinematic translate; layout-consistent targets): Stand, Run, Jet, Fall, Fire, Death
- [x] Post-physics anchor that holds standing pose without sag (see [TRADE_OFFS.md](TRADE_OFFS.md))
- [x] `Camera2D` smoothed follow + screen shake
- [x] Pulse Rifle hitscan, tracer, recoil impulse
- [x] Static target dummy that takes damage
- [x] Death: drop pose drive, apply killshot impulse, ragdoll
- [x] Limb dismemberment (left arm; constraint deletion → free ragdoll piece)
- [x] Blood particles + decal RT splat layer
- [x] Hit-pause + screen shake
- [x] HUD: health bar, jet fuel gauge, ammo, crosshair, kill feed
- [x] Headless physics tester (`make test-physics && ./build/headless_sim`)
